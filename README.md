# Lab2-JQuery
First take the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/html-css-js-intro/e/quiz--javascript-recap">Khan quiz</a> to make sure you know basic javascript. In this assignment you will implement a jquery ajax call to get the current weather. 

![Example of Weather Page](Screen%20Shot%202015-02-20%20at%202.05.21%20PM.png)

The weather section should do the following:

1) Allow the user to type characters into a form. With each keystroke, query a <a href="https://students.cs.byu.edu/~clement/CS360/ajax/getcity.cgi?q=P">REST service</a> that will return a list of cities in utah that have those characters as a prefix. This will provide a hint to the user as to what legal values can be. Put these options into a list. These [hints](https://github.com/BYUCS260/Lab2-JQuery/wiki/Getting-Suggestions-to-Work) may be helpful.

2) When the user selects the submit button, take the entry from the form and put it into the CITY box on the page. These [hints](https://github.com/BYUCS260/Lab2-JQuery/wiki/Getting-Submit-to-Work) may be helpful.

3) The submit button will also query the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs">weatherunderground REST service</a> to get the current weather for that city. These [hints](https://github.com/BYUCS260/Lab2-JQuery/wiki/Connecting-to-WeatherUnderground) may be helpful.

4) There is another input where a user can type a word, with a button that will query the [OwlBot REST service](https://owlbot.info/api/v1/dictionary/example) for the definition.

Or in other words:

- [ ] You have the basic layout of the weather form (the input box, output, etc.)
- [ ] As you type characters in the city input, the application suggests legal values
- [ ] When the submit button is pressed, you correctly fill in the City box
- [ ] You make the request to the weatherunderground site and fill in the weather div
- [ ] Users can query the OwlBot service for a definition

#### Grading:


- You will be graded as follows (there's some room for partial credit, don't worry):


Passoff Level | Behavior | Points
--- | --- | ---
Minimal Passoff | You've got the basic layout of the weather app Your basic javascript functionality works (suggestions, filling in the city box, etc.) | 45%
Passoff | Your page is lacking one or two parts of the functionality (ex. the full cities list isn't working, or the API call isn't right, etc.) |	70%
Basic Passoff | You have all the required weather functionality | 80%
Good Passoff | You utilize the other required REST service | 90%
Perfect Passoff | Your page looks really good. This is subjective, so wow us. | 100%
